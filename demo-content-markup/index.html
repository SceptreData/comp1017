		<h2>Quality Guidelines</h2>
		<p>
			These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assumethat just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time lookingfor loopholes they can exploit.

			A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of ease from six yards!

Many people find them extremely relaxing. If you have frequent muscle or joint pain, or just enjoy the luxury of a spa, you may want to consider a whirlpool tub. Whirlpool tubs are available in a wide range of sizes and types, from very small to soaker-size; freestanding to walk-in.
