				<p>
					Fat bikes have really kicked off in the last 3 years and I am sure by now you have seen one of these beast rolling down a winter trail. But what is a fat bike? Well a fat bike is a bicycle with over-sized tires, typically 3.7" or larger that are designed for riding on soft unstable terrain such as snow and sand. These bikes are built around frames with large forks and stays to accommodate the wide rims required to fit these tires. At Shepherd bikes you will find a comprehensive selection of fat bikes and if you’re into back country touring then check out the <a href="bigfoot.html">Norco Bigfoot.</a>

				<p>
					In the past year we have been inundated with request for townie bikes. These cool retro bikes have been a hit with our customers and you can customize the look of your bike to suit your personality. The revolution started here with the Electra’s Townie which it’s patented Flat Foot Technology. For most folks looking for a bike to get around town it was love at first sight. That love has made the Townie the best-selling bike in the store.

Only then will you know if the bike is right for you. There's a <a href="townie.html">Townie Bike</a> for everyone!
