The revolution started here with the Electra’s patented Flat Foot Technology to the world and it was love at first sight. That love has made the Electra the best-selling bike in the North America. Turns out people like originality. 

The Electra was born from an idea that challenged the sacred geometry of bike design and created a completely different riding experience. With an upright seating position that lets you see the world better and plant your feet flat on the ground whenever you want, it sets a new standard in comfort and control. Although most Electra bikes feature Flat Foot Technology to some degree, the Electra showcases it in all its glory.
